# HIP-002: Checksum validation

## Problem description 
Users need an address's checksum to send funds to it.
Also, when withdrawing, due to some errors, whether it is wrong address given 
by user or wrong use of hub on the exchange side, we wouldn't want the transaction 
to happen in the first place, to keep everyone happy.

## Proposed solution
**1.UserWithdraw will now validate provided address is valid using checksum.
2.GetDepositAddress will return the checksum**

## Proposed implemntation

modify existing `message` objects:
```proto
// add `checksum` to GetDepositAddressReply:
message GetDepositAddressReply {
  // Newly created deposit address
  string address = 1;
}
// Provided address should contain checksum
message UserWithdrawRequest {
  string userId = 1;
  // Address the user requests payout to. Should be without checksum.
  string payoutAddress = 2;
  // Requested withdrawal amount
  uint64 amount = 3;
  // Tag for withdrawal
  string tag = 4;
}
enum ErrorCode {


  // Provided `payoutAddress` first 81 trytes
  // does not checksum to the last 9
  CHECKSUM_INVALID = 9;
}

```
declare/instantiate types in `crypto/types.h`:

struct ChecksumTag {};
using Checksum = TryteArray<9, ChecksumTag>;

Add methods in `local_provider.h`

`Checksum calcChecksum(const string& address)`
`nonstd::optional<Address> verifyAndStripChecksum(const string& address)`
 

that will check if first 81 trytes checksums to last 9 of `addressWithChecksum`
and will only return an address if it does checksum
so, in case it does not withdrawal will fail
